# Hygiene-Sensor-Capacitance-Tester

TCL program to use SYSCOMP CGR-201 for a capacitance tester for Swipesense Hygiene Event Detector:

1- Events detection functionality: set the number of events to be tested from the GUI. The interval between two successive tests has been set to 2 seconds. A pop-up window will show the number of events detected out of the programmated ones.

2- Threshold detection functionality: start the test from the GUI. It progressively increase the capacitance on the Hygiene Sensor to detect the threshold. A pop-up window will show the measured capacitnce threshold value.
